<h1>A fun side project I did</h1>
<p>All question data is crawl from leetcode.com and saved in csv files. I did this for studying purpose only.</p>
<p>The order to read / run the script: 
    <ul>
      <li>leetcode_all_questions.ipynb (pull all the general information about leetcode questions)</li>
      <li>leetcode_specific_question_infor.ipynb (pull the more specific information about the questions)</li>
      <li>leetcode_playground.ipynb (where I generate the leetcode_very_good_questions.csv as the questions I suggested solving to land on job)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>The way I defined very good questions: those have more likes than 2 * dislikes and have more than 1000 likes. Check out leetcode_very_good_questions.csv and try to do all of them :) I sorted the questions by likes for you.</p>
<p>If this repo get super popular I will update the data :) I doubt it. Otherwise, the data is pulled from leetcode at 09/04/2021</p>
